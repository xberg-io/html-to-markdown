## Features

MDream offers a comprehensive set of features designed to make HTML to Markdown conversion efficient, flexible, and easy to integrate into your applications. From basic conversions to advanced streaming and plugin support, MDream has everything you need.

### Streaming Architecture

The streaming API allows you to process HTML incrementally, which is perfect for large documents or real-time content. Instead of loading the entire HTML into memory, MDream processes content in chunks, emitting Markdown as soon as each chunk is ready. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and provides better performance for large documents.

### Plugin System

Create custom plugins to extend MDream's functionality. Plugins can intercept the conversion process at multiple stages, allowing you to filter content, transform elements, or extract data. The plugin API is simple yet powerful, supporting hooks like beforeNodeProcess, onNodeEnter, onNodeExit, and processTextNode.

### Performance Optimizations

MDream is built with performance in mind. It uses a custom HTML parser optimized for speed, avoids unnecessary allocations, and employs V8-friendly patterns throughout the codebase. String concatenation is minimized, regex usage is carefully controlled, and the parser uses a stack-based approach to handle deeply nested structures efficiently.

### Table Support

Full support for HTML tables with proper alignment detection, colspan handling, and header formatting. MDream converts complex table structures into clean Markdown tables that preserve the original layout and content structure as closely as possible.
