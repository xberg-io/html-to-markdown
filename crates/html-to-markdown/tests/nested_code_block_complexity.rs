//! A code block deep in block quotes must not cost the square of the depth.
//!
//! Each block quote read every line of its content twice to learn which lines are indented code.
//! A code block that is `n` quotes deep was read `2n` times, each time through more quote markers.
//! With a fenced style each block quote read the markers of every line to find the fences.
//! The library converts untrusted HTML, so such growth is a denial-of-service vector.
//!
//! The bound is on the growth between two depths, not on a time: twice the depth may take at
//! most three times as long. One read for the whole document doubles the time, a read at each
//! level quadruples it.
